Initial support for free-threading enabled Python
-------------------------------------------------

The Numba code base now supports Python with free-threading enabled. When
free-threading is enabled there are two test failures for the CPU target related
to reference counting, but otherwise all the tests pass. Whilst the reference
counting problem is likely an isolated and somewhat minor issue, it does
emphasise that this work is experimental and subject to further development.

Futher, note that the deprecated ``numba.pycc`` module does not support the
creation of free-threaded AOT compiled modules.
