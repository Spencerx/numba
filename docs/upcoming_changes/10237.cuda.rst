Fix CUDA target crash bug with NVIDIA driver version 580
--------------------------------------------------------

Fixes a bug in the CUDA driver wrapper that caused the CUDA target to
crash with NVIDIA driver version 580 and later.  This was already
fixed in the `numba-cuda` package, but has been backported here for
users who haven't migrated yet.  (We still encourage all CUDA users to
switch to the `numba-cuda` package for the most up to date CUDA
support in Numba.)
