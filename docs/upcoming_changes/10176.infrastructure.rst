Control memory usage in test suite
----------------------------------

Add memory monitoring to the test suite using ``psutil`` to track and report
memory usage during test execution. Reduce test coverage on Windows GHA workers
to prevent out-of-memory failures due to 
`LLVM code-bloat issue <https://github.com/numba/llvmlite/issues/1247>`_.
