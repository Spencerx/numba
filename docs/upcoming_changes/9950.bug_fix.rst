Fix the caching of functions that call parallel=True functions.
---------------------------------------------------------------

Previously, reload_init, which keeps track of functions that need to
be called when reloading a module, was only maintained for the current
function but not called functions.  So, if the called function needed
something reloaded and the parent function was cached then the reload
would not happen.  This has been fixed by propagating the reload_init
up the call chain.
